# Scotty Resumable Upload Protocol (RUP) Implementation Guide

## 1. System Architecture

The Resumable Upload Protocol (RUP) implementation in `gapic-common` is structured across three distinct tiers to separate network execution, protocol state progression, and state transition decision logic:

```

### 1.1 Driver (Synchronous I/O Adapter)
The `Driver` executes all operations with side-effects. It interacts with HTTP transport via `Gapic::Rest::ClientStub`, reads binary data from local input streams, tracks monotonic execution deadlines, and dispatches progress callbacks. 

Crucially, the Driver delegates all **Category 1 (Transient)** transport retries directly to `Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy`. Transient retries occur entirely within the Driver's network execution wrapper. The `Core` state machine is never exposed to transient noise, receiving only verified successful HTTP responses or terminal transport exceptions.

The Driver also exposes `Driver#resume_handle`, returning a `ResumeHandle` (or `nil` if initiation has not established an upload URL). Reading this property mid-run provides a best-effort snapshot of current session parameters. In addition, `Driver#stream_position` returns the current absolute stream offset (`@buffer_start_offset + @buffer.bytesize`).

### 1.2 Core (State Container)
The `Core` maintains the immutable `State` snapshot. When `Core#dispatch(event)` is invoked by the Driver, Core forwards `@state`, the event, and static configuration to `Rules.decide`. Core mutates `@state` to `decision.next_state`, records the decision in `@last_decision`, and returns `decision.instructions` back to the Driver. Core contains zero protocol branching logic and zero side effects.

### 1.3 Rules (Pure Decision Function)
The `Rules` module encapsulates the Resumable Upload Protocol state transitions as a pure functional module. Given a state snapshot, an input event, and configuration, `Rules.decide` evaluates the transition router and returns a `Decision` snapshot containing `from_status`, `shape`, `recipe`, `next_state`, and `instructions`.

### 1.4 Stream Buffering
Because arbitrary Ruby `IO` objects (network sockets, pipes, `STDIN`) do not support seeking (`#seek`), the Driver buffers the current in-flight chunk in memory (bounded by chunk size, default: 8MB). When `RetryPolicy` executes transport retries, or when `Core` triggers Category 2 recovery realignments within the buffered range, the Driver retransmits directly from memory. The buffer is discarded only after receiving a `200 OK` durably confirming receipt of the chunk.

## 2. Component Interfaces & Data Models

### 2.1 Client Configuration (`CompleteUploadConfig`)
```ruby
module Gapic
  module Rest
    module ResumableUpload
      CompleteUploadConfig = Data.define(
        :initial_url,                      # [String] Initial endpoint URI for session initiation
        :initial_body,                     # [String] Request payload for session initiation
        :initial_headers,                  # [Hash<String, String>] Additional headers for initiation
        :stream,                           # [IO] Binary input stream to upload
        :upload_size,                      # [Integer, nil] Total upload bytes if known upfront
        :chunk_size,                       # [Integer, nil] Explicit chunk size in bytes
        :content_type,                     # [String] MIME type of uploaded media
        :timeout,                          # [Numeric, nil] Total upload timeout in seconds (zero/negative treated as nil)
        :start_retry_policy,               # [Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy, Hash, nil] Policy or hash override for start command
        :control_plane_retry_policy,       # [Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy, Hash, nil] Policy or hash override for query/cancel commands
        :data_plane_retry_policy,          # [Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy, Hash, nil] Policy or hash override for upload/finalize
        :on_progress                       # [Proc, nil] Callback: ->(progress) with a Progress instance
      )

      Progress = Data.define(
        :phase,                            # [Symbol] Upload lifecycle phase, one of Progress::PHASES
        :bytes_uploaded,                   # [Integer] Cumulative bytes acknowledged by the server (may decrease on recovery rewind)
        :total_bytes                       # [Integer, nil] Total upload size in bytes if known
      ) do
        # Important to define it via `self.`, since this block is not a class body
        self::PHASES = %i[initiating uploading recovering finalizing cancelling completed].freeze
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Progress Notification Contract (`on_progress`):**
* `on_progress` fires whenever upload status or server-confirmed byte offset changes. Sequential callbacks may report the same `bytes_uploaded`.
* `bytes_uploaded` represents the server-confirmed offset and is **not guaranteed to be monotonic** — a server rewind during recovery can decrease this value.
* Terminal failures and completed cancellations do not emit `Progress` notifications; however, entering the `:cancelling` phase does.
* Public phases (`Progress::PHASES`): `:initiating`, `:uploading`, `:recovering`, `:finalizing`, `:cancelling`, `:completed`.

### 2.2 Resume Configuration (`ResumeUploadConfig`)
```ruby
module Gapic
  module Rest
    module ResumableUpload
      ResumeUploadConfig = Data.define(
        :upload_url,                       # [String] Upload session URL returned by Scotty backend
        :chunk_size,                       # [Integer] Chunk size in bytes (> 0)
        :stream,                           # [IO] Binary input stream to upload
        :stream_offset,                    # [Integer] Starting byte offset in stream (default: 0)
        :upload_size,                      # [Integer, nil] Total upload bytes if known upfront
        :content_type,                     # [String, nil] MIME type of uploaded media
        :timeout,                          # [Numeric, nil] Total upload timeout in seconds (zero/negative treated as nil)
        :start_retry_policy,               # [Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy, Hash, nil] Unused; retained for config parity
        :control_plane_retry_policy,       # [Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy, Hash, nil] Policy or hash override for query/cancel commands
        :data_plane_retry_policy,          # [Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy, Hash, nil] Policy or hash override for upload/finalize
        :on_progress                       # [Proc, nil] Callback: ->(progress) with a Progress instance
      )
    end
  end
end
```
`ResumeUploadConfig` allows resuming an existing session directly using the session URL (typically obtained from `ResumeHandle#upload_url` or an error's `#resume_handle`).

### 2.3 Protocol State (`State`) & Decisions (`Decision`)
```ruby
module Gapic
  module Rest
    module ResumableUpload
      State = Data.define(
        :status,             # [Symbol] :initializing, :starting, :transmission_reading, :transmission_sending,
                             #          :finalizing_sending_upload, :finalizing_sending_finalize,
                             #          :recovery, :cancelling, :cancelled, :success, :error, :rejected
        :upload_url,         # [String, nil] Session upload URL returned by Scotty backend
        :offset,             # [Integer] Contiguous bytes confirmed by server (protocol_state_offset)
        :chunk_size,         # [Integer] Resolved effective chunk size
        :chunk_granularity,  # [Integer, nil] Alignment modulus returned by server
        :in_flight_length,   # [Integer] Byte length of in-flight chunk currently being transmitted
        :last_error          # [StandardError, nil] Terminal exception
      ) do
      end

      Decision = Data.define(
        :from_status,        # [Symbol] Status before transition
        :shape,              # [Symbol] Classified canonical event shape
        :recipe,             # [Symbol] Selected transition recipe method name
        :next_state,         # [State] Resulting protocol state snapshot
        :instructions        # [Array<Object>] Emitted instructions for the Driver
      )
    end
  end
end
```

### 2.4 Resume Handle (`ResumeHandle`)
```ruby
module Gapic
  module Rest
    module ResumableUpload
      ResumeHandle = Data.define(
        :upload_url, # [String] Upload session URL provided by the server
        :chunk_size  # [Integer] Effective chunk size in bytes
      )
    end
  end
end
```
`ResumeHandle` captures server-provided parameters that can be persisted to resume the upload session at a later time.

### 2.5 Events Vocabulary (Driver -> Core)
*   `Event::StartUpload`: Start a new upload session.
*   `Event::ResumeUpload.new(upload_url:, chunk_size:, upload_size:)`: Resume an existing upload session with a known upload URL.
*   `Event::ChunkRead.new(bytes_buffered:, eof:)`: Binary data buffered in Driver memory; reports total bytes ready in buffer and whether the stream hit EOF.
*   `Event::HttpResponse.new(status:, headers:, body:, error: nil)`: Dispatched for any completed HTTP exchange over the wire (including 2xx, 4xx, 5xx, or responses with missing/unexpected headers). Carries optional parsed `error` (`Gapic::Rest::Error`) when rescued from transport errors. `Core` inspects status and headers to determine protocol progression or recovery.
*   `Event::RequestFailed.new(kind:, message:, source_error:)`: Dispatched when an HTTP request fails to produce a usable HTTP response (e.g., request timeout, transport connection errors, or `RetryPolicy` exhaustion).
    *   `kind`: Normalized Symbol enum (`:timeout`, `:connection_failed`, `:retries_exhausted`). `Core` branches on `kind` and treats other fields as opaque.
    *   `message`: Human-readable summary string.
    *   `source_error`: Original underlying exception, preserved for terminal error propagation and logging.
*   `Event::Cancel`: Caller requested session cancellation.
*   `Event::GlobalDeadlineExceeded`: Absolute monotonic clock exceeded the session deadline (`@deadline`) computed at the start of `Driver#run`.

### 2.6 Instructions Vocabulary (Core -> Driver)
*   `Instruction::SendStart.new(url:, headers:, body:)`: Execute initiation request to establish upload session.
*   `Instruction::SendChunk.new(url:, offset:, length:, finalize:)`: Transmit buffered chunk of specified `length` starting at `offset`. If `finalize` is true, sends command `upload, finalize`.
*   `Instruction::SendFinalize.new(url:)`: Send standalone `finalize` command when all data bytes were already acknowledged.
*   `Instruction::SendQuery.new(url:)`: Query backend for current acknowledged offset (`query` command).
*   `Instruction::SendCancel.new(url:)`: Cancel upload session on server (`cancel` command).
*   `Instruction::RealignBuffer.new(server_offset:)`: Realign Driver in-memory buffer and stream position to match `server_offset`.
*   `Instruction::FillBuffer.new(target_bytesize:)`: Read from stream until in-memory buffer reaches `target_bytesize` bytes or stream encounters EOF.
*   `Instruction::NotifyProgress.new(progress:)`: Invoke `on_progress` callback with a `Progress` instance.
*   `Instruction::TerminateSuccess.new(response:)`: Upload finalized cleanly; Driver returns `response.body`.
*   `Instruction::TerminateFailure.new(error:)`: Raise terminal exception.

### 2.5 Driver Buffer Invariants & Stream Position Model

The Driver coordinates stream reading and in-memory buffering using four explicit offset markers:
*   `server_offset`: Contiguous byte count acknowledged by Scotty (extracted from `X-Goog-Upload-Size-Received`).
*   `protocol_state_offset`: Byte offset maintained in `State.offset`.
*   `buffer_start_offset`: Absolute stream offset corresponding to the first byte in the Driver's `@buffer`.
*   `buffer_end_offset`: `buffer_start_offset + @buffer.bytesize`.

```text
Stream Offset:   0 -----------------> buffer_start_offset -------------------> buffer_end_offset ----> (Stream EOF)
                                      |----------------- @buffer -------------|
                                                        ^
                                                  server_offset
```

#### Buffer Alignment Strategy (`Instruction::RealignBuffer`)
When `Core` resolves a recovery query or offset realignment, the Driver executes one of three alignment paths based on `server_offset`:

1.  **Case 1: Within Buffer Range (`buffer_start_offset <= server_offset <= buffer_end_offset`)**
    *   The required offset is already buffered in memory.
    *   Driver trims already-persisted bytes: `@buffer = @buffer.byteslice((server_offset - buffer_start_offset)..-1)`.
    *   Driver updates `buffer_start_offset = server_offset`.
    *   When subsequently executing `Instruction::FillBuffer(target_bytesize)`, Driver calculates `needed = target_bytesize - @buffer.bytesize` and reads only the missing difference from `stream` to complete the chunk to full `chunk_size` (unless stream reaches EOF).
2.  **Case 2: Server Offset Behind Buffer (`server_offset < buffer_start_offset`)**
    *   Occurs if the server rolls back beyond the retained buffer window.
    *   If `stream.respond_to?(:seek)`: Driver seeks the stream back to `server_offset`, resets `@buffer = "".b`, and sets `buffer_start_offset = server_offset`.
    *   If `stream` is unseekable (e.g. Socket, Pipe, STDIN): Driver raises a terminal `UnseekableStreamError` (Category 3 failure), attaching `resume_handle`.
3.  **Case 3: Server Offset Ahead of Buffer (`server_offset > buffer_end_offset`)**
    *   Occurs when resuming an existing session or when the server processed a previously timed-out request ahead of local state.
    *   If total `upload_size` is known and `server_offset > upload_size`, Driver raises a terminal `StreamMismatchError` with `resume_handle`.
    *   Driver resets `@buffer = "".b`.
    *   Driver advances the stream to `server_offset`:
        *   If seekable: `stream.seek(server_offset)`.
        *   If unseekable: Driver reads and discards `server_offset - current_stream_pos` bytes from `stream`. If the stream encounters an unexpected EOF before reaching `server_offset`, Driver raises a terminal `StreamMismatchError` with `resume_handle`.
    *   Driver sets `buffer_start_offset = server_offset`.

## 3. Component Architecture & Reference Implementation

The complete reference implementation for `Rules`, `Core`, and `Driver` is located in [reference-implementation.md](reference-implementation.md).

### 3.1 Rules Module (`Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::Rules`)
The `Rules` module is a pure functional transition engine with zero state awareness and zero side effects. It provides two primary entry points:
*   `Rules.shape_of(event)`: Classifies raw input events (`Event::StartUpload`, `Event::ChunkRead`, `Event::HttpResponse`, `Event::RequestFailed`, `Event::Cancel`, `Event::GlobalDeadlineExceeded`) into canonical symbols.
*   `Rules.decide(state, event, config)`: Evaluates `case [state.status, shape]` pattern matching to select a transition recipe symbol, dispatches via `public_send(recipe, state, event, config)`, and returns a `Decision` snapshot (`from_status`, `shape`, `recipe`, `next_state`, `instructions`).
*   `Rules.step(state, event, config)`: Convenience tuple wrapper around `Rules.decide` returning `[decision.next_state, decision.instructions]`.

Full implementation: [reference-implementation.md#1-rules-module](reference-implementation.md#1-rules-module)

### 3.2 Core Class (`Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::Core`)
The `Core` class is the state container holding the immutable `State` snapshot. It exposes:
*   `#state`: Reader for the current `State` snapshot.
*   `#last_decision`: Reader for the `Decision` recorded during the most recent `#dispatch` (or `nil`).
*   `#dispatch(event)`: Invokes `Rules.decide(@state, event, @config)`, updates `@state = decision.next_state` and `@last_decision = decision`, and returns `decision.instructions` to the Driver.

Full implementation: [reference-implementation.md#2-core-class](reference-implementation.md#2-core-class)

### 3.3 Driver Class (`Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::Driver`)
The `Driver` is the synchronous execution engine for the pure protocol state machine. When `Core#dispatch(event)` is invoked, it returns an ordered list (`Array<Instruction>`) of commands that the Driver executes in sequence.

#### Instruction Processing Semantics
The Driver categorizes instructions into three execution types:
1.  **Synchronous Side-Effects** (`NotifyProgress`, `RealignBuffer`):
    *   Executed immediately in-process.
    *   Do not yield a new `Event` and do not break the batch loop. Exceptions raised within user callbacks (e.g. `on_progress`) are not swallowed and immediately propagate to the caller.
2.  **I/O & Network Operations** (`FillBuffer`, `SendStart`, `SendChunk`, `SendFinalize`, `SendQuery`, `SendCancel`):
    *   Execute physical stream reads or HTTP requests (wrapped in `Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy` for Category 1 transient errors).
    *   Yield a single resulting `Event` (`ChunkRead`, `HttpResponse`, or `RequestFailed`) that becomes the input for the next cycle.
3.  **Terminal Handlers** (`TerminateSuccess`, `TerminateFailure`):
    *   Break the event loop and return the final response body string (`response.body`) or raise the terminal exception.

Full implementation: [reference-implementation.md#3-driver-class](reference-implementation.md#3-driver-class)

---

## 4. State Machine Protocol Rules

### 4.1 Upstream Protocol Contract
1.  **Logical Header Prefixing**: In the `start` request, logical headers describing the uploaded object must be prefixed with `X-Goog-Upload-Header-`. Specifically:
    *   `X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Type: config.content_type`
    *   `X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Length: config.upload_size` (if known upfront).
2.  **Offset Extraction**: On `query` responses, the acknowledged byte count is extracted from `X-Goog-Upload-Size-Received` as an integer (`server_offset`).
3.  **Request Modification on 4xx**: Retrying Category 2 errors requires querying the backend for `server_offset` first.
4.  **Standard Retry Configuration & Distinct Policies**: The Driver manages distinct retry policy configurations for Category 1 transient errors:
    *   **Start Policy (`start_retry_policy`)**: Applies specifically to session initiation (`start`). Configured with standard retry codes (`["UNAVAILABLE", "DEADLINE_EXCEEDED", "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED", "INTERNAL"]`) and network errors (`[Faraday::ConnectionFailed, Faraday::TimeoutError, SocketError]`). A missing or empty `X-Goog-Upload-Status` header is treated as **retriable** (predicate returns `true`) across **any response code, including 200 OK**.
    *   **Control Plane Policy (`control_plane_retry_policy`)**: Applies to session control requests (`query`, `cancel`). Configured with standard retry codes and network errors. It does **not** retry on a missing `X-Goog-Upload-Status` header, allowing `Core` to evaluate responses immediately.
    *   **Data Plane Policy (`data_plane_retry_policy`)**: Applies to data transmission requests (`upload`, `upload,finalize`, and standalone `finalize`). Shares the standard retry codes and network errors, but treats a missing `X-Goog-Upload-Status` header as **unretriable** (predicate returns `false`). This prevents blind chunk re-transmission and returns `Event::HttpResponse` immediately to `Core` so it can initiate Category 2 `Recovery`.
    *   **Retry Policy Override Contract**: Each retry policy configuration field accepts a `Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy` instance, a `Hash`, or `nil`. Passing a `RetryPolicy` instance replaces the default policy entirely. Passing a `Hash` constructs a new `RetryPolicy` and applies the category's defaults (`RetryPolicy.new(**hash).apply_defaults(defaults)`), overriding the specified fields while preserving unspecified defaults such as `retry_codes` and `retry_predicate`. Passing `nil` constructs the default policy directly from the category defaults.

### 4.2 State Transition & Data Mutation Specification

**State Classification:**
* **Non-Terminal States**: `Initializing`, `Starting`, `Transmission | Reading from stream`, `Transmission | Sending`, `Finalizing | Sending with upload`, `Finalizing | Sending finalize`, `Recovery`, `Cancelling`.
* **Terminal States**: `Success`, `Cancelled`, `Error`, `Rejected`.

## 5. Chunk Size Adjustment Rules

Upon receiving `200 OK` from the `start` request, `Core` inspects the response headers for `X-Goog-Upload-Chunk-Granularity`. The effective chunk size (`effective_chunk_size`) stored in `State` is resolved using the following variable definitions and rules:

### 5.1 Variable Definitions
*   `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`: Default chunk size of `8_388_608` bytes (8 MB).
*   `user_chunk_size`: Explicit chunk size specified in `CompleteUploadConfig.chunk_size` (or `nil` if unspecified).
*   `chunk_granularity`: Required byte alignment modulus parsed from header `X-Goog-Upload-Chunk-Granularity` as an Integer (or `nil` if header is absent).
*   `effective_chunk_size`: Final calculated byte size used by Driver for in-memory buffering and chunk transmission.

### 5.2 Resolution Rules

#### Rule 1: No Server Granularity Specified (`chunk_granularity` is nil or 0)
When the server does not specify a granularity requirement:
*   If `user_chunk_size` is provided: `effective_chunk_size = user_chunk_size`.
*   If `user_chunk_size` is omitted: `effective_chunk_size = DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`.

#### Rule 2: Default Chunk Size with Server Granularity (`user_chunk_size` is nil, `chunk_granularity > 0`)
When the user does not specify a chunk size, the default 8 MB chunk size is aligned down to the nearest multiple of `chunk_granularity`:
*   `effective_chunk_size = DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE - (DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE % chunk_granularity)`.
*   If `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE < chunk_granularity`, `effective_chunk_size` is promoted to `chunk_granularity`.

#### Rule 3: User Specified Chunk Size with Server Granularity (`user_chunk_size > 0`, `chunk_granularity > 0`)
When an explicit `user_chunk_size` is supplied alongside a server `chunk_granularity`:
*   **Case 3A (Standard Alignment: `user_chunk_size >= chunk_granularity`)**:
    *   The user chunk size is aligned down to the nearest integer multiple of `chunk_granularity`:
    *   `effective_chunk_size = user_chunk_size - (user_chunk_size % chunk_granularity)`.
    *   If `user_chunk_size` is already a multiple of `chunk_granularity` (`user_chunk_size % chunk_granularity == 0`), `effective_chunk_size = user_chunk_size`.
*   **Case 3B (User Size Below Granularity: `user_chunk_size < chunk_granularity`)**:
    *   If `user_chunk_size` is strictly less than `chunk_granularity`, downward alignment would produce `0` bytes (an invalid chunk size).
    *   To satisfy the server's mandatory granularity constraint, `effective_chunk_size` is promoted to `chunk_granularity`.

### 5.3 Reference Implementation
```ruby
def self.resolve_chunk_size(user_chunk_size, chunk_granularity)
  base_size = user_chunk_size || DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE
  return base_size if chunk_granularity.nil? || chunk_granularity <= 0
  return chunk_granularity if base_size <= chunk_granularity

  base_size - (base_size % chunk_granularity)
end
```

## 6. Error Classification & Recovery Flows

### 6.1 Error Categories
The implementation distinguishes three categories of network and protocol-level failures:

#### 6.1.1 Category 1: Transient Transport Failures
*   **Definition**: Standard TCP, network connection timeout, DNS, or server load-shedding errors that do not compromise the protocol session.
*   **Examples**: `503 Service Unavailable`, `408 Request Timeout`, `429 Too Many Requests`, `Faraday::ConnectionFailed`, `Faraday::TimeoutError`.
*   **Resolution**: The `Driver` intercepts these errors inside the physical execution wrapper and delegates directly to `Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy`. If retries succeed, `Core` receives `Event::HttpResponse`. If retries exhaust attempt/timeout limits, Driver emits `Event::RequestFailed(kind: :retries_exhausted, ...)`.

#### 6.1.2 Category 2: Recoverable Protocol Failures
*   **Definition**: Responses indicating that the client's current offset is misaligned with the server, protocol headers are missing/stripped on completed requests, or unretried transport connection failures during data transmission.
*   **Conditions Producing `:response_cat2`**:
    1.  **Non-200 Active Responses**: Any response with `X-Goog-Upload-Status: active` where HTTP status is non-200.
    2.  **Missing or Empty `X-Goog-Upload-Status` Header**: Any response lacking `X-Goog-Upload-Status` (or empty) whose HTTP status is **not** in `FATAL_STATUS_CODES` (Section 6.1.3). This includes HTTP 200, 5xx server/gateway errors (`500`, `502`, `503`, `504`), and recoverable client errors (`400`, `408`, `409`, `412`, `416`, `429`, `499`).
    3.  **Unretried Data Plane Connection Drops or Request Timeouts**: `Event::RequestFailed(kind: :connection_failed)` or `Event::RequestFailed(kind: :timeout)` (`:request_connection_failed`, `:request_timeout`) occurring during `Transmission` or `Finalizing`.
*   **Missing Header Handling & Retry Policy Contract**:
    *   *Why Headers Go Missing*: Intermediate proxies, reverse-proxies, or Google Front End (GFE) edge proxies can strip Scotty response headers or return raw HTML/text error pages on failure.
    *   *Session Initiation (`start`)*: Missing `X-Goog-Upload-Status` is treated as **retriable** by `start_retry_policy` (retry predicate returns `true`) across **any response code, including 200 OK**. Driver retries transparently to smooth over transient gateway noise. If retries exhaust, `Starting` transitions to `:error` via `fail_with_request_error` or `fail_with_bad_response` (cannot recover a session before an upload URL is obtained).
    *   *Session Control (`query`, `cancel`)*: `control_plane_retry_policy` does **not** treat missing status headers as retriable, returning the completed `Event::HttpResponse` immediately to `Core` so it can manage protocol recovery or fail fast.
    *   *Data Plane (`upload`, `upload, finalize`, standalone `finalize`)*: Missing `X-Goog-Upload-Status` is treated as **unretriable** by `data_plane_retry_policy` (retry predicate returns `false`). The Driver immediately returns `Event::HttpResponse` to `Core` so it classifies as `:response_cat2` and initiates Category 2 `Recovery` via `Instruction::SendQuery` rather than blindly re-transmitting data.
*   **Resolution**: Core transitions to `Recovery` and emits `Instruction::SendQuery.new(url: state.upload_url)` to obtain `server_offset`.

#### 6.1.3 Category 3: Terminal Failures & Fatal Status Codes
*   **Definition**: Irrecoverable errors where either the request is structurally invalid, unauthorized, transport retry limits are exhausted, unseekable rewind is needed, or the server has explicitly aborted/rejected the session.
*   **Canonical Fatal Status Codes (`FATAL_STATUS_CODES`)**:
    The following status codes indicate structural or authentication failures that cannot be resolved by querying the Scotty backend:
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication token is expired, invalid, or missing.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Caller lacks required IAM permissions for the upload destination.
    *   `404 Not Found`: Session upload URL does not exist or has expired.
    *   `405 Method Not Allowed`: HTTP method is rejected by the server.
    *   `410 Gone`: Upload session has been permanently removed.
    *   `413 Payload Too Large`: Upload chunk or overall size exceeds server limit.
    *   `415 Unsupported Media Type`: Object content type is rejected.
    Responses with these status codes are classified as `:response_fatal_bad_response` even if the `X-Goog-Upload-Status` header is absent.
*   **Other Terminal Conditions**:
    *   **Retry Exhaustion**: Any `Event::RequestFailed(kind: :retries_exhausted)` occurring at any stage. When Category 1 transport retries are exhausted by the `RetryPolicy`, failure is immediate and terminal; it does not enter Category 2 `Recovery`.
    *   **Session Rejection**: Any response with `X-Goog-Upload-Status: final` and non-2xx status code (`:response_rejected` -> raises `Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::UploadRejectedError`).
    *   **Initiation Failure**: Any 4xx/5xx or `Event::RequestFailed` during `Starting` (`:error` -> raises `Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::BadResponseError` or source error).
    *   **Session Cancellation**: Cancelled upload sessions raise `Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::UploadCancelledError`.
    *   **Global Deadline Expiration**: Monotonic clock exceeding session deadline raises `Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::DeadlineExceededError`.
    *   **Unseekable Stream Rewind**: Server offset rolled back behind retained buffer (`server_offset < buffer_start_offset`) on an unseekable stream (raises `Gapic::Rest::ResumableUpload::UnseekableStreamError`).
*   **Resolution**: Core transitions to `:rejected` or `:error` and emits `Instruction::TerminateFailure`.

#### 6.1.4 Actionable Terminal Errors & Metadata Propagation
Terminal errors provide actionable context so downstream SDK callers can inspect error metadata:
*   **Error Classes**:
    *   `BadResponseError < Gapic::Rest::Error`: Unrecoverable non-2xx HTTP responses or invalid payloads. Retains `attr_reader :response_body` returning `event.body`, and includes `HasResumeHandle`.
    *   `UploadRejectedError < Gapic::Rest::Error`: Backend explicitly rejected the session with `X-Goog-Upload-Status: final`. Retains `attr_reader :response_body` returning `event.body`. Does NOT include `HasResumeHandle` (session is terminated permanently).
    *   `UploadCancelledError < Gapic::Common::Error`: Upload session cancelled by caller. Does NOT include `HasResumeHandle` (session is terminated permanently).
    *   `DeadlineExceededError < Gapic::Common::Error`: Upload deadline exceeded with optional root cause (`attr_reader :root_cause`), and includes `HasResumeHandle`.
    *   `UnseekableStreamError < Gapic::Common::Error`: Stream rewind required on an unseekable stream; includes `HasResumeHandle`.
    *   `InvalidTransitionError < Gapic::Common::Error`: Unexpected event dispatched for state; includes `HasResumeHandle`.
    *   `StreamMismatchError < Gapic::Common::Error`: Stream content or length does not match resumed upload specifications; includes `HasResumeHandle`.
    *   `RequestFailedError < Gapic::Common::Error`: Terminal HTTP request failure (e.g. transport connection failure, request timeout, or retries exhausted). Retains `attr_reader :cause` returning the underlying error, preserves REST error attributes (`status_code`, `status`, `details`, `headers`) when available, and includes `HasResumeHandle`.
*   **Resume Handle Propagation (`HasResumeHandle`)**:
    *   The `HasResumeHandle` mixin exposes `attr_reader :resume_handle` returning a `ResumeHandle` (or `nil` if session initiation was incomplete or if the session was `:rejected` or `:cancelled`).
    *   Whenever `resume_handle` is non-nil, the uniform suffix `" (upload session is resumable: see #resume_handle)"` is automatically appended to the error message.
*   **Metadata Sourcing & De-prefixing**:
    *   When `event.error` is present (from `Gapic::Rest::Error.wrap_faraday_error`), factories source `status_code`, `status`, `details`/`status_details`, and `headers`/`header`.
    *   The prefix literal `Gapic::Rest::Error::REST_ERROR_PREFIX` (`"An error has occurred when making a REST request"`) is stripped from `event.error.message` to avoid redundant prefixes.
    *   The resulting actionable message follows the format:
        *   For `UploadRejectedError`: `"Upload rejected by server with HTTP #{status_code} #{status_name}: #{inner_message}"` (e.g., `"Upload rejected by server with HTTP 403 PERMISSION_DENIED: The caller does not have permission"`).
        *   For `BadResponseError`: `"Resumable upload failed with HTTP #{status_code} #{status_name}: #{inner_message}"` (e.g., `"Resumable upload failed with HTTP 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Quota limit reached"`).
*   **Fallback Formatting**:
    *   When `event.error` is absent, factories fall back to `event.status` and `event.headers`, naming the status and including the detailed `X-Goog-Upload-Status` header:
        *   For `UploadRejectedError`: `"Upload rejected by server with HTTP #{event.status} #{status_name} (X-Goog-Upload-Status: 'final')"`.
        *   For `BadResponseError`: `"Resumable upload failed with HTTP #{event.status} #{status_name} (X-Goog-Upload-Status: #{upload_status_desc})"`.
    *   `response_body` on `BadResponseError` and `UploadRejectedError` returns `event.body`.

### 6.2 Recovery and Buffer Alignment
When `Core` resolves a `query` response in the `Recovery` state, it updates `State.offset` (`protocol_state_offset`) to `server_offset` (extracted from `X-Goog-Upload-Size-Received`) and transitions to `Transmission | Reading from stream`.

To realign the upload state, the `Driver` processes `Instruction::RealignBuffer(server_offset)` using its in-memory buffer and stream position tracking:
1.  **Within-Buffer Alignment (`buffer_start_offset <= server_offset <= buffer_end_offset`)**:
    *   The Driver trims already-persisted bytes: `@buffer = @buffer.byteslice((server_offset - buffer_start_offset)..-1)`.
    *   The Driver updates `buffer_start_offset = server_offset`.
    *   Upon executing the accompanying `Instruction::FillBuffer(target_bytesize)`, the Driver reads `target_bytesize - @buffer.bytesize` bytes from `stream` to restore `@buffer` to full `chunk_size` before transmitting.
2.  **Rewind Required (`server_offset < buffer_start_offset`)**:
    *   If `stream.respond_to?(:seek)`: the Driver seeks to `server_offset`, clears `@buffer = "".b`, and sets `buffer_start_offset = server_offset`.
    *   If `stream` is unseekable (e.g. Socket, Pipe, STDIN): the Driver raises terminal `UnseekableStreamError` (Category 3), attaching `resume_handle`.
3.  **Fast-Forward Required (`server_offset > buffer_end_offset`)**:
    *   If total `upload_size` is known and `server_offset > upload_size`: Driver raises terminal `StreamMismatchError` with `resume_handle`.
    *   The Driver clears `@buffer = "".b`.
    *   If `stream.respond_to?(:seek)`: seeks to `server_offset`.
    *   If unseekable: reads and discards `server_offset - current_stream_pos` bytes from `stream`. If the stream encounters unexpected EOF before reaching `server_offset`, Driver raises terminal `StreamMismatchError` with `resume_handle`.
    *   The Driver sets `buffer_start_offset = server_offset`.

### 6.3 Sensible Defaults for Global Deadline
Every upload session executed via `Driver#run` must have a finite, guaranteed upper bound on total wall-clock execution time. Without a mandatory global deadline, a session encountering repeated Category 2 protocol recoveries or intermittent network stalls could hang indefinitely.

To guarantee termination, `Driver#run` establishes an absolute monotonic deadline at the very start of execution:
```ruby
@deadline = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) + resolve_timeout
```

#### Timeout Resolution Algorithm (`resolve_timeout`)
The total session timeout is resolved in priority order:
1.  **Explicit User Timeout (`config.timeout`)**: If `config.timeout` is present and strictly positive (`config.timeout&.positive?`), that value is used directly. Zero or negative values are treated as unset (`nil`).
2.  **Size-Proportional Timeout (`config.upload_size`)**: If total `upload_size` is known upfront, the timeout is computed assuming a minimum sustained upload throughput of `MIN_ASSUMED_THROUGHPUT = 1_048_576` bytes/sec (1 MB/s), floored by `BASE_TIMEOUT = 3_600` seconds (1 hour):
    ```ruby
    [config.upload_size.fdiv(MIN_ASSUMED_THROUGHPUT), BASE_TIMEOUT].max
    ```
    *Rationale*: Using `BASE_TIMEOUT` as a floor prevents sub-millisecond timeouts for small payloads while scaling linearly for multi-gigabyte uploads.
3.  **Default Base Timeout (`BASE_TIMEOUT`)**: If neither a positive timeout nor `upload_size` is provided (e.g., streaming uploads of unknown length), the timeout defaults to `BASE_TIMEOUT` (`3_600` seconds).

#### Bounding Transport Retries by Global Deadline
Transport retries and individual HTTP exchanges must never exceed the remaining global deadline. When `Driver#make_post_request` invokes `ClientStub#make_post_request`, it computes the per-request timeout from the remaining session budget (`max(deadline - monotonic_now, 0)`), additionally capped by `retry_policy.timeout`:
```ruby
remaining = [@deadline - Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC), 0].max
timeout = retry_policy&.timeout ? [remaining, retry_policy.timeout].min : remaining
```
This timeout is passed in `options[:timeout]`, ensuring that underlying Faraday requests and `Gapic::Common::RetryPolicy` evaluations always respect the remaining upload budget.

---

## 7. Observability Standards

### 7.1 Architecture & Separation of Concerns
Because `Rules` is a pure decision engine and `Core` is a side-effect-free state container, protocol decisions are encoded as immutable `Decision` data structures and logged exclusively by the `Driver` via `Driver::UploadLog`.

Each invocation of `Driver#run` generates a fresh UUIDv4 session identifier (`uploadId`) that is attached to every log entry emitted during that run. Structured log entries are constructed using `Gapic::LoggingConcerns` (`StubLogger` yielding a `LogEntryBuilder` producing `Google::Logging::Message` instances). Machine-readable state and telemetry are stored in `Google::Logging::Message#fields`, allowing log message text to evolve independently without breaking structured queries.

### 7.2 Log Level & Recipe Mapping
The `Driver` emits structured logs across three severity levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`). High-frequency per-chunk acknowledgements (`:ack_chunk`) and duplicate cancellation signals (`:ignore_duplicate_cancel`) are suppressed from `INFO` lifecycle logs to avoid log volume bloat on multi-gigabyte uploads.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `INFO` | Lifecycle | `:start_session` | Initiating resumable upload |
| `INFO` | Lifecycle | `:begin_transmission` | Upload session established |

    *   `status`: Current protocol status symbol (on `unmatched_transition`).
    *   `error`: Exception message string (on `fail_with_*` and `unmatched_transition`).
    *   `responseBody`: Abridged error response body from `last_error.response_body` when present (on `fail_with_*`).

    *   `method`: Always the string `"POST"`.
    *   `url`: Abridged request target URI.
    *   `headers`: Redacted HTTP header hash.
    *   `startAttempt`: Retry attempt counter (`Integer`).
    *   `command`: Value of `X-Goog-Upload-Command` request header.
    *   `offset`: Parsed integer value of `X-Goog-Upload-Offset` request header (`wire_send`).
    *   `bodySize`: Total byte length of request payload (`Integer`).
    *   `body`: Abridged payload or error body snippet.

    *   `serverOffset`: Target byte offset reported by the server (`Integer`).
    *   `currentOffset`: Local buffer start offset before realignment (`Integer`).

### 7.4 Redaction & Payload Abridgement
To prevent credential leakage and ensure log volume is proportional to the number of requests and independent of payload size, `Driver::Abridge` and `ClientStub` enforce strict sanitization rules before any entry is passed to the logger:

1.  **URL Query Elision (`Abridge.url`)**: Upload session URLs contain capability tokens in their query parameters (e.g., `upload_id`, `sid`). `Abridge.url` parses the URI and replaces every query parameter value with `<...>` (e.g., `https://storage.googleapis.com/upload?upload_id=<...>`).
2.  **Header Allowlisting (`Abridge.headers`)**: Only protocol control headers prefixed with `x-goog-upload-` retain their values in log entries (with `x-goog-upload-url` passed through `Abridge.url`). All other request and response headers—including `Authorization` or custom metadata—are replaced with `"<...>"`. Note that Faraday injects `Authorization` headers below the `ClientStub` logging layer; tests verify that bearer tokens never appear in logs.
3.  **Binary Payload Abridgement (`Abridge.bytes` & `ClientStub#abridge_request_body`)**:
    *   In `Driver::Abridge.bytes`, binary payloads of 64 bytes or more are abridged to their first 32 bytes encoded in hexadecimal followed by the total byte size: `"<first 32 bytes hex>... <N bytes>"`.
    *   In `Gapic::Rest::ClientStub#log_request`, any request body exceeding 1 KiB (1024 bytes) or containing non-UTF-8 binary data is abridged to `"<N bytes, first 32: <hex>>"`, preventing 8 MiB upload chunks from being dumped into `DEBUG` logs.
4.  **Error Body Truncation (`Abridge.error_body`)**: HTTP error response bodies (status $\ge 400$) are forced to UTF-8 encoding with invalid byte sequences scrubbed and truncated to at most 512 characters.

### 7.5 Enabling & Configuring Logging
Logging is disabled by default (`logger: nil`) and incurs negligible allocation overhead when inactive. Users and test harnesses can enable logging via two mechanisms:

1.  **Environment Variable Opt-In (`GOOGLE_SDK_RUBY_LOGGING_GEMS`)**:
    Setting the `GOOGLE_SDK_RUBY_LOGGING_GEMS` environment variable activates default `Logger` instances writing to `$stderr` at `DEBUG` level (using `Google::Logging::StructuredFormatter` when running in a Google Cloud environment):
    *   `GOOGLE_SDK_RUBY_LOGGING_GEMS=all` or `GOOGLE_SDK_RUBY_LOGGING_GEMS=true`: Enables logging across all Google Cloud Ruby SDK components.
    *   `GOOGLE_SDK_RUBY_LOGGING_GEMS=gapic-common`: Enables logging specifically for `gapic-common` (including `ResumableUpload::Driver` and `ClientStub`).
    *   `GOOGLE_SDK_RUBY_LOGGING_GEMS=false` or `none`: Explicitly disables SDK logging even if a default logger is configured.
2.  **Explicit Logger Injection**:
    Pass any Ruby `::Logger`-compatible instance directly to `Driver.new(client_stub: stub, config: config, logger: my_logger)` or configure it on the parent service client config.
