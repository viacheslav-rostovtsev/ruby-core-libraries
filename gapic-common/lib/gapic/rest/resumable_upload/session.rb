      # Coordinates a resumable upload across its lifecycle.

      # A Session performs exactly one run (`start` or `resume`), never both, never twice.
      #
      # ### Two-State Model
      # 1. **Unbound** (`!bound?`): Fresh session prior to execution. Permitted operations: `start`
      #    or `resume(...)`.
      # 2. **Bound** (`bound?`): Session has executed or bound to an upload URL. Permitted operations:
      #    none (`start` and `resume` both raise {SessionStateError}).
      #
      # Calling {resumable?} reports whether a new session can resume the upload (`!resume_handle.nil?`).
      # Completed uploads (`:success`), rejected uploads, and cancelled uploads are finalized and not
      # resumable (`resumable?` returns `false`, `resume_handle` returns `nil`).
